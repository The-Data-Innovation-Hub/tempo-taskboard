-- Remove the line that tries to add the table to the realtime publication
-- since the publication is already defined as FOR ALL TABLES

-- This migration is a fix for the previous migration that tried to add
-- the projects table to the supabase_realtime publication

-- No action needed here since tables are automatically included in FOR ALL TABLES publications
