-- Create required storage buckets if they don't exist
-- This migration creates the task_files and avatars buckets

-- Note: Storage bucket creation is handled by the create_task_files_bucket edge function
-- This migration serves as documentation and a placeholder

-- The actual bucket creation is done via the edge function which can be invoked from the SupabaseConfigCheck component
-- See supabase/functions/create_task_files_bucket/index.ts for implementation details

-- No SQL commands are executed in this migration to avoid errors when run without proper credentials
